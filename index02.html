			<h2>Pomelos Health Benefits</h2>
            
            	<p>Pomelo is an unusual citrus fruit that has numerous health benefits. However, you have to be willing to do a bit of searching for this citrus fruit to get those benefits. Surprising health benefits of pomelos include: </p>

                <section>
                <h3 itemprop="possibleTreatment">improving immune system</h3>
                    <p>considering  their size, a single serving is less than the whole fruit, but you still might eat the whole fruit, and each fruit contains about 600% of your daily vitamin C requirement. The pomelo has a major source of ascorbic acid, and it has been used for generations in the Southeast part of Asia, to quickly boost the immune system.</p>
                <h3 itemprop="possibleTreatment">lowering blood pressure</h3>
                    <p>Pomelos are a good source of potassium, they contain about 37% of your daily requirement. Potassium is vasodilator, which means it releases tension of blood vessels, increases blood circulation, and oxygenation of organ systems. This reduces strain on the heart, and lower chances of atherosclerosis, heart attacks, and strokes.</p>
                <h3 itemprop="possibleTreatment">improving digestion</h3>
                    <p>We know that most fruits are high amounts of fiber, and so do pomelos. the edible flesh only  of One pomelo, contains about 25% of your daily fiber requirements, which promotes healthy digestion that eliminates constipation and diarrhea. High fiber content builds up stool, smooths the movement in the digestive tract, stimulates secretions and gastric juices of digestive to break down complex proteins and difficult to digest foods. This is what keeps the digestive system functioning at a high level.</p>
                <h3 itemprop="possibleTreatment">enhancing bone strength</h3>
                    <p>Bone enhancement is achieved by Potassium intake, which is connected to bone mineral density. This helps facilitate the uptake of other essential minerals that aids in keeping bones strong. Pomelos can therefore aid in osteoporosis prevention and bone weakness throughout the body.</p>
                <h3 itemprop="possibleTreatment">anti-aging</h3>
                    <p>Pomelos large levels of vitamin C, act as antioxidants, which seeks dangerous free radicals. The single thing, unfortunate, that free radicals cause is skin degradation, and premature aging signs like saggy skin, wrinkles, and age spots. High vitamin C intake can prevent this. Eating more pomelos, while helping skin degradation and premature aging, also contains spermadine, which is a rare chemical that’s actually found in human sperm, and has been closely linked to anti-aging properties.</p>
                <h3 itemprop="possibleTreatment">reducing cramping</h3>
                    <p>Potassium also balance fluid in the body. This is important because it is a key aspect of muscle cramping and stiffness. Pomelos can supply proper amounts of potassium for the body, that without it, you are more prone to cramping and more susceptible to pulled muscles and torn ligaments.</p>
                <h3 itemprop="possibleTreatment">weight loss</h3>
                    <p>Pomelos and grapefruits contain a fat-burning enzyme called Carnitine pamitoyl-transferase, that potentially helps reduce your weight. It’s not found in many foods. but can really boost your battle against the bulge. That is why many dieters choose to include Pomelos and grapefruits in a healthy eating habit for weight loss.</p>
